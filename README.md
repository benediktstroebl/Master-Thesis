# Estimating the success of re-identification in GPS trajectory datasets without user identifiers

This is the corresponding repository to my Master Thesis **Estimating the success of re-identification in GPS trajectory datasets without user identifiers**. It does not contain any data files due to privacy reasons.

## Abstract

## Methodology

### Data

### Attack

### Evaluation

## Conclusion

for future algorithm development.

## Disclaimer

I have used GitHub co-pilot during implementation of the outlined research and relied on it for suggesting code writing comments and plotting.
